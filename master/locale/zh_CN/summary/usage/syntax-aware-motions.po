"`Alt-p`, `Alt-o`, `Alt-i`, and `Alt-n` (or `Alt` and arrow keys) allow you "

"There is also some nuanced behavior that prevents you from getting stuck on "
"a node with no sibling. When using `Alt-p` with a selection on `arg1`, the "
"previous child node will be selected. In the event that `arg1` does not have "
"a previous sibling, the selection will move up the syntax tree and select "
"the previous element. As a result, using `Alt-p` with a selection on `arg1` "
"will move the selection to the \"func\" `identifier`."
