"To help with quick navigation, Helix maintains a list of \"jumps\" called "
"the jumplist. Whenever you make a significant movement (see next section), "
"Helix stores your selections from before the move as a jump. A jump serves "
"as a kind of checkpoint, allowing you to jump to a separate location, make "
"edits, and return to where you were with your previous selections. This way, "
"the jumplist tracks both your previous location and your selections. You can "
"manually save a jump by using `Ctrl-s`. To jump backward in the jumplist, "
"use `Ctrl-o`; to go forward, use `Ctrl-i`. To view and select from the full "
"jumplist, use `Space-j` to open the jumplist picker."
