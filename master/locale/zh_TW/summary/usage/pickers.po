"Helix has a variety of pickers, which are interactive windows used to select "
"various kinds of items. These include a file picker, global search picker, "
"and more. Most pickers are accessed via keybindings in [space mode](./keymap."
"md#space-mode). Pickers have their own [keymap](./keymap.md#picker) for "
"navigation."

"Most pickers perform fuzzy matching using [fzf syntax](https://github.com/"
"junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#search-syntax). Two exceptions are the "
"global search picker, which uses regex, and the workspace symbol picker, "
"which passes search terms to the language server. Note that OR operations (`|"
"`) are not currently supported."

"If a picker shows multiple columns, you may apply the filter to a specific "
"column by prefixing the column name with `%`. Column names can be shortened "
"to any prefix, so `%p`, `%pa` or `%pat` all mean the same as `%path`. For "
"example, a query of `helix %p .toml !lang` in the global search picker "
"searches for the term \"helix\" within files with paths ending in \".toml\" "
"but not including \"lang\"."

"You can insert the contents of a [register](./registers.md) using `Ctrl-r` "
"followed by a register name. For example, one could insert the currently "
"selected text using `Ctrl-r`\\-`.`, or the directory of the current file "
"using `Ctrl-r`\\-`%` followed by `Ctrl-w` to remove the last path section. "
"The global search picker will use the contents of the [search register](./"
"registers.md#default-registers) if you press `Enter` without typing a "
"filter. For example, pressing `*`\\-`Space-/`\\-`Enter` will start a global "
"search for the currently selected text."
