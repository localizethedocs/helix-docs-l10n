"Rainbow queries have two captures: `@rainbow.scope` and `@rainbow.bracket`. "
"`@rainbow.scope` should capture any node that increases the nesting level "
"while `@rainbow.bracket` should capture any bracket nodes. Put another way: "
"`@rainbow.scope` switches to the next rainbow color for all nodes in the "
"tree under it while `@rainbow.bracket` paints captured nodes with the "
"current rainbow color."

"Then we'll add `@rainbow.scope` captures. The easiest way to do this is to "

"blob/48b5e9f82ae0a4727201626f33a17f69f8e0ff86/grammar.js). As we scroll down "
"the `grammar.js`, we see that the `(alternation)`, (L36) `(group)` (L57), "
"`(named_node)` (L59), `(predicate)` (L87) and  `(wildcard_node)` (L97) nodes "
"all contain literal parentheses or square brackets in their definitions. "
"These nodes are all direct parents of brackets and happen to also be the "
"nodes we want to change to the next rainbow color, so we capture them as "
"`@rainbow.scope`."
