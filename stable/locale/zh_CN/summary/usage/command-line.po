"By default, command arguments are split on tabs and space characters. `:open "
"README.md CHANGELOG.md` for example should open two files, `README.md` and "
"`CHANGELOG.md`. Arguments that contain spaces can be surrounded in single "
"quotes (`'`) or backticks (`` ` ``) to prevent the space from separating the "
"argument, like `:open 'a b.txt'`."

"Double quotes may be used the same way, but double quotes _expand_ their "
"inner content. `:echo \"%{cursor_line}\"` for example may print `1` because "
"of the expansion for the `cursor_line` variable. `:echo '%{cursor_line}'` "

"On Unix systems the backslash character may be used to escape certain "
"characters depending on where it is used. Within an argument which isn't "
"surround in quotes, the backslash can be used to escape the space or tab "
"characters: `:open a\\ b.txt` is equivalent to `:open 'a b.txt'`. The "
"backslash may also be used to escape quote characters (`'`, `` ` ``, `\"`) "
"or the percent token (`%`) when used at the beginning of an argument. `:echo "
"\\%%sh{foo}` for example prints `%sh{foo}` instead of invoking a `foo` shell "
"command and `:echo \\\"quote` prints `\"quote`. The backslash character is "
"treated literally in any other situation on Unix systems and always on "

"Command flags are optional switches that can be used to alter the behavior "

"Expansions take the form `%[<kind>]<open><contents><close>`. In `%sh{echo "

"delimiters. The following open/close characters are recognized as expansion "
"delimiter pairs: `(`/`)`, `[`/`]`, `{`/`}` and `<`/`>`. Plus the single "
