"Helix's editing model is strongly inspired from Vim and Kakoune, and a "
"notable difference from Vim (and the most striking similarity to Kakoune) is "
"that Helix follows the `selection → action` model. This means that whatever "
"you are going to act on (a word, a paragraph, a line, etc.) is selected "
"first and the action itself (delete, change, yank, etc.) comes second. A "
"cursor is simply a single width selection."
