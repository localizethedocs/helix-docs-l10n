"Helix uses tree-sitter to correctly indent new lines. This requires a tree- "
"sitter grammar and an `indent.scm` query file placed in `runtime/queries/ "
"{language}/indents.scm`. The indentation for a line is calculated by "
"traversing the syntax tree from the lowest node at the beginning of the new "
"line (see [Indent queries](#indent-queries)). Each of these nodes "
"contributes to the total indent when it is captured by the query (in what "
"way depends on the name of the capture."

"By default, Helix uses the `hybrid` indentation heuristic. This means that "
"indent queries are not used to compute the expected absolute indentation of "
"a line but rather the expected difference in indentation between the new and "
"an already existing line. This difference is then added to the actual "
"indentation of the already existing line. Since this makes errors in the "
"indent queries harder to find, it is recommended to disable it when testing "
"via `:set indent-heuristic tree-sitter`. The rest of this guide assumes that "
"the `tree-sitter` heuristic is used."
