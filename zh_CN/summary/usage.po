"Helix is a modal editor, meaning it has different modes for different tasks. "
"The main modes are:"
msgstr ""

#: src/usage.md:14
msgid ""
"[Normal mode](./keymap.md#normal-mode): For navigation and editing commands. "
"This is the default mode."
msgstr ""

#: src/usage.md:15
msgid ""
"[Insert mode](./keymap.md#insert-mode): For typing text directly into the "
"document. Access by typing `i` in normal mode."

"[Select/extend mode](./keymap.md#select--extend-mode): For making selections "

"Buffers are in-memory representations of files. You can have multiple "

msgid "Selection-first editing"
msgstr ""

#: src/usage.md:24
msgid ""
"Inspired by [Kakoune](http://kakoune.org/), Helix follows the `selection → "
"action` model. This means that whatever you are going to act on (a word, a "
"paragraph, a line, etc.) is selected first and the action itself (delete, "
"change, yank, etc.) comes second. A cursor is simply a single width "
"selection."

msgid "Multiple selections"
msgstr ""

#: src/usage.md:28
msgid ""
"Also inspired by Kakoune, multiple selections are a core mode of interaction "
"in Helix. For example, the standard way of replacing multiple instances of a "
"word is to first select all instances (so there is one selection per "
"instance) and then use the change action (`c`) to edit them all at the same "
"time."

#: src/usage.md:32
msgid ""
"Motions are commands that move the cursor or modify selections. They're used "
"for navigation and text manipulation. Examples include `w` to move to the "
"next word, or `f` to find a character. See the [Movement](./keymap."
"md#movement) section of the keymap for more motions."
